Now that your Serverless application is deployed to an AWS account, let's check if it is running as expected. 

#### Open the CloudFormation console
Navigate to the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home), make sure you are in the same region where you have been working on so far. You should see the new stack _sls-api_ in the CREATE_COMPLETE status.

#### Test the App

Click on the **sls-api** stack and then go to the **Outputs** tab. In this tab, you will see the API Gateway URL, the Lambda function ARN and the IAM Role ARN for the function. To test our application, **copy the API Gateway endpoint URL and pase it in a new browser window**. 

When you navigate to this URL in the browser, API Gateway is invoking the Hello World Lambda function. If everything works, you will see Lambda response:

If your application created a HTTP endpoint, the Outputs `HelloWorldApi` generated by `sam deploy` also show you the endpoint URL for your test application. You can use curl to send a request to your application using that endpoint URL. For example:

```bash
curl https://x5qbf4eacg.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/hello/
```

#### Congratulations! 
You have successfully deployed a Serverless application! Let's automate deployments now!
