## Amplify React

Basic Authentication flow, including: User Sign-Up, User Sign-In, Multi-Factor Authentication, User Sign-Out.

### 1. Deploy with the AWS Amplify Console

The AWS Amplify Console provides hosting for Fullstack Serverless Web-apps. Deploy this app to your AWS account with a single click:

[![amplifybutton](https://oneclick.amplifyapp.com/button.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home#/deploy?repo=https://github.com/nnthanh101/sls-app)

The Amplify Console will fork this repo in your GitHub account, and then build and deploy your backend and frontend in a single workflow. Your app will be available at `https://master.~appid~.amplifyapp.com`.

### 2. Run locally with the Amplify CLI

2.1. Clone the repo that was just forked in your account

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:<username>/sls-app.git

  cd sls-app && npm install
  ```

2.2. Import the backend environment deployed by the Amplify Console to your repo (the `amplify/team-provider.json` file contains information on all backend environments in your AWS account). The GIF below shows how you to copy the `amplify env import` command from the Amplify Console.

2.3. Paste this command into your terminal at the root of your repo. You should see the `amplify/team-provider.json` updated with a backend named `amplify`.

  ```
  amplify pull
  ```


2.4. Run locally

  ```
  npm start
  ```
